Prints all projects that have a commit with the same Change-Id.

The output format is one line per project with the project name,
the path to it and the ref for Git to fetch it.

The script needs to run to be run in the root directory of the
repo checkout (as the manifest file needs to be parsed to get the
paths to the projects).
