This directory contains Ansible configs for launching CV Linux slaves
which are hosted on separate VMs.

restart_cv_dockerslaves.yml - this is an Ansible playbook which does
the necessary steps to restart a single slave on port 2222 of a VM.
It expects the Ansible host to have /home/couchbase/jenkinsdocker-ssh
available, and will synchronize it to the host.

inventory - this is an Ansible inventory which specifies the current
set of VMs for these CV slaves, along with their cv.jenkins slave names.

The above can be run with:

  docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/mnt \
  -v /home/couchbase/jenkinsdocker-ssh:/home/couchbase/jenkinsdocker-ssh \
  couchbasebuild/ansible-playbook -v -i inventory restart_cv_dockerslaves.yml
