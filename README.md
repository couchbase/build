build
=====

This repository is used to store scripts used by automation tools like Jenkins, cgi
scripts for querying build history data, and tools used in the release process. It
also contains copies of internal server configuration, such as for Gerrit.

_Credentials for build robots and for access to resources will be kept in a separate, private repository._
